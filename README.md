<h1 align="center">hola ðŸ‘‹- i'm curtain_</h1>

I am a Java/C# developer/student also with an emphasis in System Administration and cyber security.
I have experience working with the Spigot Minecraft API, with other areas of work in C# .NET, Linux/Windows server administration, etc.
This is where I put my random things, so enjoy

some code on here is absolute garbage, trust me my private repos are much better
